✓ Current Price: ₹3,650
```

### Supported Data Sources

## 💡 Best Practices

### Transaction Management

1. **Daily Logging**: Add transactions same day as execution
2. **Include All Fees**: Brokerage, STT, stamp duty for accurate P&L
3. **Use Notes**: Add context like "Dip buy" or "Profit booking"
4. **Verify Data**: Double-check auto-filled data before saving

### Portfolio Diversification

**Ideal Allocation:**
- **Sectors**: No single sector > 30%
- **Market Cap**: 
  - Conservative: 70% Large, 20% Mid, 10% Small
  - Balanced: 50% Large, 30% Mid, 20% Small
  - Aggressive: 40% Large, 30% Mid, 30% Small

**Red Flags:**
- 🔴 > 50% in one sector
- 🔴 > 40% in one industry
- 🔴 > 80% in one market cap category

### Data Quality

1. **Correct Symbols**: Use exact NSE codes (TCS, not tcs)
2. **Refresh Prices**: Click "Refresh Prices" daily
3. **Review Analytics**: Monthly portfolio review
4. **Clean Data**: Delete duplicate transactions
